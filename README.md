# Auto MC Server
Thank you for using Auto MC Server (AMCS) (currently v0.1 ALPHA)!
AMCS allows you to quickly setup and self-host a public Minecraft server without having to port-forward for FREE!

Please download the binaries attached (either the ZIP file or the executable and the `README.txt` file).

## Prerequisites
Please ensure you have an Ngrok account (https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup). Then, copy your authtoken from here: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

## Additional Notes
Please note that the public address given to you is not static. This is why it is recommended you use the "Direct Connection" method since you will have to re-share the address each time you launch the server. We are trying to resolve this issue, although it is a paid Ngrok feature, so free users will likely have to use non-static public addresses.

## Performance
Generally, you'll want at least 2GB (default value) of RAM for your server. Ideally, 4GB or more should suffice for larger or modded servers.
